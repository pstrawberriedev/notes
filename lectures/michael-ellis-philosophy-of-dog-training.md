#### Quick Vocab

- Compulsion Training
  - A dog training method that --?
- Leash Correctoin Training
  - A dog training method that helps the dog to move with leash pressure (to be guided by the leash) instead of working against it
- Pressure
  - A term used to indicate applying pressure to the dog, whether it be holding the dog, or pulling its leash to direct it
- Reward-based Training
  - A dog training method that uses rewards and reward markers as a means of establishing patterns of behavior
- Primary Reinforcer
  - Food / Toy
  - The object that drives motivation
- Conditioned Reinforcer
  - "Yes"
  - A [word] the dog has been conditioned to understand which indicates a reward is coming
- Conditioned Punisher
  - "No!"
  - A [word] the dog has been conditioned to understand which indicates what they did was incorrect and a punishment is coming

#### Markers (marker word / reward marker / bridge)
- A word denoting a "mark in time" whereby the dog is given feedback about his action
- *Pavlov's Classical Conditioning* interpretation: treat proceeds marker word
  - if the treat comes at the same time as the marker word, the classical conditioning method is ineffective
- Without a verbal marker, the ~1second "reward window" would be much too difficult to consistently hit.
- With a verbal marker, the dog is conditioned to associate the marker word with the act of receiving a reward - this allows behavior-chaining
- "Using a marker word, the dog knows that it got rewarded for doing exactly what it was doing when it heard the word"
- **Release Marker**
  - Indicates successful completion of the desired behavioral condition
  - Whatever the dog was doing to get the reward it can immediately stop and "act naturally" to seek the reward
- **Praise Marker**
  - Indicates the dog is correctly performing an action and should continue doing so
  - "You're doing a good job, keep doing what you're doing!"
  - The praise marker is conditioned regularly, at home, or whenever the dog is getting praise (giving him food, petting him, "you're a good boy")

#### Active/Operant vs. Reactive behavioral frameworks
- Active / Operant
  - the dog has realized his actions have an impact on his environment, and therefore seeks to act in a way that will reward him. In training, he are constantly seeking to figure out which of their actions initiated reward.
- Reactive
  - the dog's behavior is being driven by the reward.
  - "Every dog starts out as a reactive dog"
  - A reward marker facilitates the transition from a reactive to an active dog

#### Action vs. Duration training
- **Action**
  - A single action performed by the dog ("sit", "watch", "down", "heel")
  - Uses a Release Marker
- **Duration (also see continuous duration reinforcement)**
  - Duration can indicate one of two things:
    - *An action held for a longer period of time before release*
    - *A sequence of actions (chained actions)*
  - Uses a praise marker for the intermediary steps of the duration sequence, and a release marker upon completion of the sequence
  - i.e. ("sit", "good", "watch", "good", "down", "yes")

#### Continuous duration reinforcement
- When beginning to chain together multiple actions, it is better to start off rewarding each action individually ("sit", "yes", "down", "yes", "stand", "yes")
- After continually reinforcing each individual action, it is easier for the trainer to implement complex chains of actions

#### Action stability reinforcement (reward without release)
- If the dog is having trouble holding actions before the release marker, "action stability" needs to be reinforced.
- Similar to continuous duration reinforcement, action stability is built upon praise markers
- Instead of using a release marker, the trainer simply rewards the dog after the praise marker to enforce action stability
- i.e. ("sit", "good", -reward-, "good")

#### Non-reinforcement
- Marker: "Nuh uh"
- Should be explicitly separate from the punishment marker
- Indicates to the dog they performed incorrectly and to try again
- i.e. ("lay", -dog sits-, "nuh uh", -move treat away?-, "lay", -dog lays-, "yes")

#### Conditioned Punisher
- Marker: "No!"
- This is a corrective method used when the dog is absolutely not allowed to do something (chase a car, bite somebody, etc.)
- (What is the correct/socially-acceptable action to take for a punisher?)

#### Obedience Training 101 (puppies / new adoptions / new owners)
- NO CORRECTIONS/PUNISHMENTS
- The entire point is to get the dog used to you / your voice, to establish trust, and to create an environment in which good behavior is promoted (rewarded)
  - Remember "Reactive vs. Active" behavioral frameworks - if the dog is punished for trying to act, it will eventually cease trying to act (because it associates a punishment with trying/exploration of behavior).
  - Corrections or punishments for young dogs will undermine the transition from a reactive to an active dog (which is exactly the point of the early stages of obedience training, and the foundation upon which all future training is built - "dog becomes conscious of his impact upon the environment/world")
