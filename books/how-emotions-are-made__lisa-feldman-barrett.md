# How Emotions are Made by Lisa Feldman Barrett

1. "Classical view" of emotions
   -   The "classical view" of emotions is described as one which places emotions in the category of a series of biological, "hard-wired" phenomena, ready to fire off when the appropriate stimuli is presented.
   - For the "classical view", the following description is offered:
      -  ``...it seems reasonable to assume that each emotion has a defining underlying patter in the brain and body``
      - ``...a fixed component of our biological nature``
      - ``universal (biological/cultural)``
      - *@ Introduction, xi*

2. "Theory of constructed emotion"
   - ``[emotions] are real in the same sense that money is real - that is, hardly an illusion, but a product of human agreement``
   - ``[my brain] constructed an experience of emotion``
   - ``Using bits and pieces of my past experience...my brain rapidly predicted what my body should do to cope...``
   - ``...[my brain] made the resulting sensations meaningful as an act of sadness``
